# Aetherium Manifest

Aetherium Manifest is a **Cognitive Visualization System**  
designed to manifest AI intention, confidence, and internal state  
as light, motion, and abstract forms.

This project is not a chatbot UI, avatar, or dashboard.  
It is a **Manifestation Layer** — the perceptual body of intelligence.

## Core Philosophy

- No avatars
- No faces
- No traditional UI elements

Only:
- Light
- Motion
- Coherence
- Resonance

Aetherium Manifest visualizes *how intelligence feels*,  
not *what it looks like*.

---

## System Role

Aetherium Manifest operates as a **Frontend Manifestation Layer**  
connected to the AI cognition system via:

- **Aetherium Protocol** (API / WebSocket Contract)
- Intent vectors
- Confidence and coherence signals
- Emotional and cognitive states

It does not make decisions.  
It **expresses** them.
